https://github.com/akserg/learning_bootstrap4_angular2 initially i was sceptical due to closed source bias and the amount of errors i found in this book, screenshots are on googleplus here: https://plus.google.com/u/0/+NilsNaegele. further exploration of the chapters the quality of the content approaches that of the documentation and i discovered that the author is on the right side of the force. present open source solutions adequately next time, you can influence alot of people in writing a book. i am ready to fly, my muse.
